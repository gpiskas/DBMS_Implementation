DBMS Implementation
===================

This project contains four fundamental functions of a DBMS system (External Mergesort, Merge-Join, Hash-Join, Duplicate Elimination) that are designed to work in real-life and extreme circumstances (Huge input data, extremely low available memory).

The tools used for the implementation are:
<ul>
<li>C++ 11 std</li>
<li>GNU g++ 4.7.2 compiler</li>
<li>GNU gdb 7.5 debugger</li>
</ul>

Use the main.cpp file as a driver. You can create new files of any size and execute any of the previously mentioned functions. Upon completion, apart from execution time, you will be informed about statistics such as the number of I/O operations or the amount of sorted segments that were created. <br> Note: Upon compiling, make sure you use the -O3 flag for extra optimization.
